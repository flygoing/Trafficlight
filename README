/:light/:power
	Type: GET
	Payload: ":light" is the light to change ('green', 'yellow', 'red', or 'all')
		 ":power" is one of three states
			 "on": Turns the light on
			 "off": Turns the light off
			 "just": Turns the light on and turns others off NOTE: Not available for 'all', nothing will happen.
				If just is given, you may also set two GET paramters that will cycle the light:
					frequency: How often to cycle off/on, in milliseconds. NOTE: Please don't set frequency lower than 25 millis!!
					millis: How long to cycle it, in milliseconds.

Examples:
	localhost:3000/red/on
		Will turn the red light on

	localhost:3000/green/just
		Will turn red/yellow off and green on

	localhost:3000/all/off
		Will turn all lights off

	localhost:3000/yellow/just?frequency=100&millis=1000
		Will turn red/green off and cycle yellow on/off for 1 second every 100 milliseconds

	localhost:3000/all/just?frequency=25&millis=5000
		Nothing will happen because "just" is only available for the individual lights

	localhost:3000/
		Just returns a webpage that calls the on/off api with qwe and asd
